# Hello-World
Beginning work on github
I'm learning Ruby on Rails. I know something about HTML, CSS, Javascript. I'm working on Windows Visual Studio.
I need to learn how to create and manage web sites.
Working with Ruby and InstantRuby I end up in a Git window. I need a better understanding of what I am doing there.
